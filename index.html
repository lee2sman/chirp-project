			<h2>About Chirp</h2>
			<p>Chirp is a bare bones social media project that has the ability to post images and text.</p>
			<p>When making a post, the program will send out a sound cue that lets you know your post is up.</p>
			<p>Honestly we did not know what else to put in here.</p>
		</div>
	<h4>Please read and agree to the code of conduct to continue.</h4>
		<div class="conduct-rules">
			<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

			<p>If you don’t insult somebody for 2 weeks you will also be banned and have your account deleted.</p>
			<p>On the insults messages you send if you receive likes your account is awarded points.</p>

			<h3>Have genuine interest and joy in the community.</h3>
			<p>Have fun, you know it’s a toxic place if you have a problem, close the site and shut off your computer. Try to respect these people like your own pals, being toxic can be fun if you all know it’s a joke.</p>
